## Demo

![vite-mern-template-gh-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78271602/234833309-fe8df564-2895-4727-be1e-c807fe142333.gif)

## Installation

```bash
npx degit apicgg/vite-mern-template my-app
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
cd my-app
cd client
npm install
cd ..
npm install
```

## Start the development server

```bash
npm run watch
npm run dev
```

- Run the above two commands on different terminal sessions.

- Remove the .git folder and initialize your own git repository.
- In this case `npm run watch` needs to be executed before starting the development server with `npm run dev` as the TypeScript files need to be compiled to JavaScript before staring the dev server with node. `ts-node` can be used this to avoid this.

## TODO

- Include testing frameworks, eslint and prettier.
- Create a npm CLI library for scaffolding projects.

## Running the tests
1. Unit Testing:
- Frontend (React.js): Utilize testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library for component-level testing. Ensure UI components work as expected and efficiently.

### And coding style tests
Frontend (React.js, Material-UI, Tailwind):
- ESLint for JavaScript/JSX: Configure ESLint to check for code style adherence in your React.js code. You can use popular configurations like Airbnb's ESLint config or create a custom one tailored to your project.
- Prettier Integration: Integrate Prettier with your code editor and your build process. Prettier automatically formats your code to adhere to your chosen style guidelines.
- Material-UI and Tailwind CSS Guidelines: Follow the coding and styling guidelines provided by Material-UI and Tailwind CSS to ensure consistency in your UI components and styles.

Backend (Node.js, Express.js):
- ESLint for Node.js: Use ESLint to enforce coding style rules in your Node.js and Express.js backend code. You can use a popular ESLint config for Node.js, or create a custom one that aligns with your team's preferences.
- Consistency in Routing and Middleware: Ensure that your Express.js routes and middleware functions follow a consistent naming and structure convention. For instance, establish guidelines for naming your route files and methods.

Database (PostgreSQL):
- SQL Linting: Consider using a SQL linter or formatter to maintain consistency and readability in your database queries. These tools can check for consistent indentation, proper capitalization, and other SQL coding style rules.

Machine Learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow, NLTK, spaCy):
- Python Linting: Use a Python linter, such as Flake8 or Pylint, to enforce coding style and best practices in your machine learning code. This ensures proper indentation, naming conventions, and adherence to PEP 8 standards.

Cloud and Deployment (Docker, Kubernetes):
- Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML Files: Establish guidelines for Dockerfiles and Kubernetes YAML files. Ensure that they are well-structured, readable, and follow best practices.

Git and Version Control (Git + Github):
- Git Hooks: Implement pre-commit and pre-push Git hooks that automatically run linting checks before allowing developers to commit or push code. This ensures that no code violating the style guidelines is added to the repository.
- Enforce Branch Policies: Utilize branch protection rules on your GitHub repository to ensure that code is only merged into specific branches after passing code style checks.

Continuous Integration (CI) Checks:
- Include Linting in CI/CD Pipeline: Add linting checks as a step in your CI/CD pipeline. Your CI system can automatically run linting tests and prevent code that doesn't meet the coding style guidelines from being deployed.
